# Brothers in Arms (BiA) — State 2436

## Overview
Brothers in Arms is a recurring kill event where points are earned primarily by destroying enemy troops, with some formats also awarding points for troop losses, and it commonly aligns with the week that includes Sunfire Castle activities.  
This event is intensive PvP by design and is treated differently by each state's NAP to balance competitiveness with troop preservation and fairness among alliances.  

## Schedule and Format
BiA typically runs during the broader weekly cycle that also includes facility and castle-related combat windows, with exact timings determined by server schedule and state age progression.  
Because BiA overlaps with high-activity windows, councils often set pre-announced "engagement windows" or city-attack protocols to prevent unnecessary escalation and to protect lower-power participants.  

## Scoring Basics
Points are awarded for eliminating enemy units in the wilderness (e.g., on tiles or during marches) and in city assaults, with some versions also awarding points for own-troop losses; consult in-game event details for precise values in the current season.  
Scoring typically favors efficient troop trades, so alliances coordinate rallies, target selection, and reinforce/retreat rules to maximize net points while minimizing permanent losses.  

## Common NAP Rules (Examples)
- No friendly-fire: prohibit attacks on registered NAP alliances' cities and gatherers unless explicitly lifted for BiA windows by a council vote.  
- Tile etiquette: if tile hits are allowed, define targets (non-NAP or enemy-only) and set restitution protocols for mistakes, with screenshots for evidence.  
- Rally conduct: require public pings and verified targets to avoid accidental hits on protected parties during chaotic windows.  

## Coordination Tips
- Prioritize high-value, low-risk targets such as under-defended cities or marches and coordinate rallies to concentrate power where success odds are highest.  
- Align BiA efforts with facility/castle windows only when the council authorizes it, as those battles can yield outsized points but also higher casualty risk.  

## Violations and Evidence
- Require timestamped battle reports and screenshots for any alleged violation, and route disputes through the council channel specified in state governance docs.  
- Use a penalty ladder (warning → temporary removal from BiA privileges → exclusion from NAP benefits) based on severity and repetition, recorded in the violations log.
