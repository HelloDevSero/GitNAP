# State of Power (SvS) â€” State 2436

## Overview
State of Power (SvS) pits two states against each other across a multi-day cycle that includes a matchmaking segment, a five-day Preparation Phase with daily scoring themes, and a Battle Phase with live PvP and strategic objectives.  
It typically occurs every four weeks, lasts ten days (longer than King of Icefield), and offers top-tier rewards plus the chance for leadership titles that can span both states depending on outcomes.  

## Timeline
- Matchmaking (2 days): the system analyzes state power/activity and pairs against a similarly matched opponent; the opponent reveal comes on day two of matchmaking.  
- Preparation Phase (5 days): each day has specific scoring categories (e.g., building, research, training, gear, beasts), with daily and total rankings and milestone rewards.  
- Battle Phase: timed PvP objectives culminating in the castle battle; the prep winner receives a state bonus and the castle battle location advantage during the Battle Phase.  

## Scoring Highlights (Preparation Phase)
Daily themes reward points for actions like construction, research, troop training, item use (e.g., Hero Gear Essence), pet progression, and beast hunts; exact values rotate and are detailed in the event UI each season.  
Players and alliances pursue both daily and overall milestone rewards (e.g., Gems, Speedups, Resources, Sunfire Tokens) and ranking rewards across personal and alliance leaderboards.  

## NAP Policy Guidance
- Preservation protocols: NAP councils often restrict intra-state PvP during preparation to protect troop strength and focus on event scoring efficiency.  
- Battle-phase rules: define city-attack permissions, rally targets, and tile/gatherer etiquette against the opposing state while preventing friendly-fire among NAP alliances.  

## Coordination Tips
- Pre-plan item usage to match daily scoring themes (e.g., construction vs. training day) to maximize milestone and ranking returns for both players and alliances.  
- Align alliance rally schedules and reinforcements during the Battle Phase, using scouts and timed marches to seize map objectives efficiently.  

## Rewards and Outcomes
Winners of the Preparation Phase gain advantageous buffs (e.g., healing/enlistment capacity) and hosting advantages for the castle battle, which can influence titles and overall SvS outcomes.  
Conclude by documenting post-event learnings, including item usage plans that performed best and any NAP rule adjustments for future SvS cycles.
